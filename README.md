# cpp-sudoku
Simple sudoku solver; doesn't work for all, the algorithm is quite naive. This is my first (bigger than Hello World) program in C++.

It was written quite some time before the upload date, during a dark age: when I only knew std::vectors as a method of storing structured data (no arrays, no multidimensional arrays).
I've later been enlightened.
